Here, in the REST call, we are not setting the Content-Type as multipart/form-data. The browser will do it for us along with setting up the multipart boundary. Else, we will get the error as org.apache.tomcat.util.http.fileupload.FileUploadException: the request was rejected because no multipart boundary was found  at the server-side.
